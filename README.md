# ServerCloner
This project was made to allow users to copy servers without having the `Administrator` permission when they're unable to add a bot to the server.

## Setup
- Download as a ZIP, or `git clone https://github.com/ElijahGives/ServerCloner.git`
- Run `install.bat`
- Run `start.bat`. If it doesn't work, edit it with your python prefix, it's default set to `py`.

## Known Bugs
- Currently, when it creates channels and categories, it doesn't set the overwrites/permissions, and I'm looking for someone to commit a fix to this as I'm stumped on what to do for it.
- Delays on changing steps: fixing this in a future update.
