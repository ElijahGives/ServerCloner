# server-cloner
This project was made to allow users to copy servers without having the Administrator permission when they're unable to add a bot to the server.

## Setup
- Download as a ZIP, or `git clone https://github.com/ElijahGives/server-cloner.git`
- Run `install.bat`
- Edit `config.py` to the configuration you need.
- Run `start.bat`.

### Account Termination
There is a chance that your account could get terminated when running this script, likely when cloning a big server.
Consider using an alt account to protect your accounts. :)
